                <p class="date">21 Feb 2024</p>

<p>Much has been said about how there can be ‘day’ and ‘night’ during the Creation if the sun wasn't created until the fourth day.</p>

<p>On this, I would simply point out that the Genesis explicitly defines what is meant by ‘day’, in (Genesis, 1:5):</p>

<p><div class="quote">
    <sup class="footnote-number">5</sup>God called the light ‘day’, and the darkness<br>
    He called ‘night’.
</div></p>

<p>Taking the Bible literally seems to solve the issue. God
created light, and He called it ‘day’. Darkness, on the
other hand, was called ‘night’. This is consistent with the
fact that in Biblical times, the day end was marked by sunset, rather than midnight.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the source of light that separates days is the
sun. During the first few days of creation, the source had
to be something else. What the source was is irrelevant –
the point is that this source of light defines the day.</p>

<p>It also follows that there is no reason to believe the
first few days of the Creation were 24 hours in length.
It could have been longer, or even shorter. There’s not
even a reason to believe that the length of the first days
of the Creation were the same: each day could have had
a different duration.</p>
