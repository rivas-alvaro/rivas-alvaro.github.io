                <p class="date">18 Feb 2024</p>

<p>Omnipotence, as well as the related properties of
omniscience and omnipresence, is part of the Christian
doctrine. However, is God really omnipotent, according to
the Bible?</p>

<p>Reading the Bible, I incline to think He isn’t. There’s
no doubt His powers, according to the Bible, are great –
but I don’t think He is technically omnipotent.
The extent of God’s powers is discussed in various
parts of the Bible, but they all seem to be in accordance
to (Psalm 115:3):</p>

<p><div class="quote">
    <sup class="footnote-number">3</sup>Our God is in the heavens;<br>
    He does all that He pleases.
</div></p>

<p>We are told that God can do anything He pleases – anything
he desires, or wishes. This is often interpreted as
God being omnipotent, but it is not so.</p>

<p>Certainly, an omnipotent being would be able to accomplish
anything he desires. But omnipotence is not
necessary to achieve this.</p>

<p>Consider the statement “Mr Jones can buy whatever
he pleases”. Does that mean Mr Jones has unlimited
money? No, it simply means that if Mr Jones desires
something, he can buy it. If he can’t buy something, he
doesn't desire it.</p>

<p>Similarly, God can do whatever He pleases. This
doesn't mean He can do anything. There might be things
He cannot do; but in this case, He doesn't please to do
them.</p>

<p>Stating that God is omnipotent based on this statement from
the Bible is simply overreaching: it is assigning
attributes to God that are not deduced from it.</p>

<p>This literal interpretation of (Psalm 115:3), and others
similar to it, also solves the logical paradox of whether
God can create an immovable rock. At first glance, assuming
God is omnipotent, this is a paradox: if He wasn't
able to, He wouldn't be omnipotent; if He is omnipotent,
He should be able to create it. But God should be able to
move it too – meaning it is not really an immovable rock.</p>

<p>In view of the given interpretation of (Psalm 115:3), we
see this needs not be a paradox. God can do anything
He pleases. If He cannot create an immovable rock, it is
because He doesn't please to. If he can create one, then
He simply doesn't please to move it. There is no paradox
here.</p>
