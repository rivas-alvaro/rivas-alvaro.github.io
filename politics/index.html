<p>Disagreements are the bread and butter of politics.
An old joke about economists says that if you put 10
economists in a room, you will get 11 opinions. The same
seems to be true about politicians as well. Politicians have
different views about the role of the state in our lives and
these views often appear polar opposites at a fundamental level.
Are these views so different, though? Are these
disagreements in kind, or simply disagreements in degree?
Are these opposing views different in essence, or are they
different sides of the same coin?</p>

<p>We tend to classify political views on a onedimensional spectrum.
One side is labelled as the
left, and it includes socially liberal and economically
interventionist policies. The other side is labelled as the
right, which captures economically liberal and socially
interventionist policies. If more granularity is needed,
further dimensions may be added. The Nolan Chart<sup class='footnote-number'><a href='#footnote-1'>1</a></sup>
divides the political spectrum along two axes, personal
and economic freedom. Political policies are then placed
in this chart based on whether they result in more or less
personal and economic freedom.</p>

<p>This way of classifying political positions is a reflection
of how political decision-making is popularly viewed.
Modern policy-making is a consequentialist and utilitarian
exercise: a good policy is one that improves welfare.
As such, we divide political views according to their consequences.
The view that advocates for higher taxes or
more welfare support is placed on one end of the spectrum,
while the view that promotes less corporate regulation or
tighter immigration control is placed on another.
However, both views aim to improve welfare of society
- they just disagree how this might be achieved. Differences
between points on the spectrum are like different
ice cream flavours: a chocolate ice cream is very different
to a pistachio ice cream - but it is still ice cream. What
if I don’t want ice cream? What if I want, say, a Belgian
waffle?</p>

<p>Consequentialism judges actions or policies based on
its consequences: if a policy has a good outcome, it is a
good policy. If a policy has a bad outcome, it is a bad policy.
A consequence of this is that the same policy may
be desirable at one point in time, but undesirable at a
later time. Utilitarianism, as a form of consequentialism,
judges actions according to a utility function. The higher
an action’s value as per the utility function, the better
the action is. The aim is to find policies that maximise
such utility function. Most political parties are consequentialist
utilitarians: they are akin to different flavours
of the same ice cream; somewhat different, but only superficially.</p>

<p>Deontology, on the other hand, ignores the consequences of actions
and looks at the action itself to decide if it’s right or
wrong. It is fundamentally different
from consequentialism. It is not just another flavour of
ice cream: it is a Belgian waffle. As deontology makes no
reference to the consequence of actions, it is universal and
time-invariant in nature.</p>

<p>For example, a deontologist might judge a policy on
whether it respects certain individual rights. If it doesn’t,
the policy is unjust and shouldn’t be pursued, no matter
how beneficial it might be for an individual or society.
If the policy respects or restores individual rights then
it may be pursued, regardless of the outcomes of doing
so. If it happens to lead to a better society, that’s great.
If it leads to a society where everyone is worse off from a
welfare perspective, that’s an unfortunate side effect - but
it has no bearing on the decision of whether the policy
should be pursued or not.
Far from being deontologist, current politics revolve
around either</p>

<p><b>1.</b> improving welfare of society, or</p>

<p><b>2.</b> improving welfare of a group of society.</p>

<p>As such, modern politics is a utilitarian exercise where
the goal is to find welfare-maximising policies. Disagreement
only arises from (a) how to choose the utility function and
(b) how to achieve such welfare improvement,
according to the chosen utility function. It is therefore
a difference in degree, not a difference in kind. Of the
two sources of disagreement, the second one is the most
contentious one.</p>

<p>Even when a policy that protects an individual right is
defended, it is usually done so by appealing to its positive
effects (ie by appealing to 1. or 2. above) rather than with
right-based arguments. In other words, in the current political
debate individual rights and freedom are means to
an end - improved welfare - rather than ends in themselves.
For deontologists, the precise opposite is true: individual rights
and freedom are examined and studied as
ends in themselves, and if they have merits when viewed
as such then policies promoting these are to be pursued.</p>

<p>Utilitarianism overwhelmingly dominates politics,
whereas deontological arguments are conspicuous by
their absence.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, certain people believe they are
making a deontological, right-based argument when in
reality their argument is utilitarian at its core. This is often
the case even for some human rights advocates: they
defend certain policies by appealing to individual rights
when, under close inspection, their defence is just utilitarianism in disguise.</p>

<p>Some others do believe that some rights are fundamental to human beings,
but they then abandon these rights on certain cases on utilitarian
grounds. When asked about this inconsistency of appealing to a right
on some cases but denying it on others, they often reply that
the right is actually subordinate to other utilitarian
considerations - which means that it’s no right at all<sup class='footnote-number'><a href='#footnote-2'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>
When asked about the inconsistency of appealing to
the right to do with one’s body as they please in the first
case but denying this right in the second case, 
"How will this political party help me?" "How will
the policies this politician promotes benefit my community,
my town, my country?" These are common questions people ask
themselves when deciding which political candidate deserves
their vote. Voters think in utilitarian terms and
they expect utilitarian answers. People
find the idea of promoting a policy with demonstratively
harmful consequences for society, let alone themselves as
individuals, alien at best and laughable at worst, even if
not pursuing the policy would infringe individual rights.
But it shouldn’t be. Deontological arguments for and
against public policy should be part of political discussion.
Politicians and voters might still settle for consequentialist,
utilitarian arguments for a policy, but they
should at least be able to justify why deontological considerations
for or against the policy were dismissed.</p><h3>Notes</h3>
