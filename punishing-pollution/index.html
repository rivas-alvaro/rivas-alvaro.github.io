                <p class="date">16 Aug 2023</p>

<p>I was reading <i>Hot Money</i>, by Naomi Klein. There, the
author advocates for stopping (or greatly reducing) pollution,
which she (rightly, I believe) considers to be illicit.
As part of the condemnation of pollution, she argues that
fossil-fuel corporations warrant punitive measures commensurate
with their contribution to climate risk. This, I believe, is a mistake, as whereas
polluting is illicit activity, the business of these companies
is not.</p>

<p>
Fossil-fuel companies principally extract raw hydrocarbons, refine them into marketable products such as gasoline, and sell these commodities to downstream users. The extraction and refining process generates measurable direct emissions<sup class='footnote-number'><a href='#footnote-1'>1</a></sup>. Nevertheless, the overwhelming share of climate-warming pollution occurs when consumers combust the fuel<sup class='footnote-number'><a href='#footnote-2'>2</a></sup>. The buyers are therefore the immediate emitters of carbon and, on Klein's “polluter-pays” account, the parties liable for sanction. By contrast, producers do not themselves release these downstream emissions<sup class='footnote-number'><a href='#footnote-3'>3</a></sup> and thus are not, strictly speaking, the agents committing the illicit act.</p>

<p>
The same reasoning applies to manufacturers of internal-combustion vehicles. While the vehicles emit pollutants during operation, the manufacturing and sale of the automobile itself constitute licit commercial activities; it is the driver who activates the engine and releases exhaust gases.</p>

<p>If policymakers extend liability to fossil-fuel producers merely because they facilitate pollution, they must confront a regress of complicity. The engineering firm supplying specialised drilling rigs, the steelmaker producing the rig's structural components, and even financial institutions providing capital could be deemed accessories, thereby diluting accountability<sup class='footnote-number'><a href='#footnote-4'>4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Rigorous, single-entry carbon accounting is essential for transparent climate governance. Yet current practice often double- or triple-counts the same tonne of CO₂ across multiple ledgers, allocating emissions to the producer, the transporter, and the consumer simultaneously.</p>

<p>Consider an avocado grown in California and consumed in the United Kingdom. Life-cycle assessments allocate aviation and shipping emissions to several actors: the farmer, the logistics provider, the retailer, and the purchaser. Assigning identical molecules of CO₂ to four distinct agents violates elementary bookkeeping principles and inflates aggregate inventories.</p>

<p>The correct procedure is straightforward: each tonne of CO₂ should appear once, in the ledger of the physical emitter. I emit nothing when simply purchasing the avocado; the trans-Atlantic carrier does. If pollution is illicit, moral culpability attaches to the emitter alone; entities that enable but do not themselves emit are not, in this narrow sense, acting unjustly.</p><h3>Notes</h3>
