                <h2 id="page-title">Punishing an illicit activity, or the activity that facilitates it?</h2>
                
                <p class="date">16 Aug 2023</p>

<p>I was reading <i>Hot Money</i>, by Naomi Klein. There, the
author advocates for stopping (or greatly reducing) pollution,
which she (rightly, I believe) considers to be illicit.
As part of the condemnation of pollution, she charges
against fossil fuel-producing companies, advocating for
punishing them. This, I believe, is a mistake, as whereas
polluting is illicit activity, the business of these companies
is not.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the business of fossil fuel-producing
companies consists of extracting the fossil fuel, possibly
producing derivative products out of it (eg gasoline out
of oil) and selling it. They don’t really pollute, as far I
can tell – not, at least, beyond the typical business of
its size. The extraction of fossil fuels might incur pollution,
but the bulk of the overall pollution produced
by the extracted fuel is not due to actions by the fossil
fuel-producing company. The polluters are the buyers
of these products. They are the ones releasing carbon to
the atmosphere. They are the ones that should be punished.
The fossil fuel-producing companies are not the
ones committing the illicit act.</p>

<p>The same applies to car manufacturers. Even though
their product (assuming it’s not an electric car) does pollute
when used, the act of producing and selling is a licit
one. It is the end users – the drivers – the ones that should
be punished.</p>

<p>If you are willing to punish fossil fuel-producers because they
facilitate the illicit act that is polluting, you
are running into a slippery slope. If an engineering company
supplies the oil-extracting machinery (specialised
machinery only used for oil extraction) they are too facilitating
the polluting, so they would also need to be punished. The
same would apply to the steel manufacturing
company that provided the steel to the engineering company – and so on.</p>

<p>We should keep track of strict carbon accounting.
However, the problem with how carbon accounting (assigning the
amount of carbon emitted to an individual) is often done is double-counting.
The same molecule of carbon is assigned to multiple parties.</p>

<p>Say I buy an avocado that was grown in California.
The avocado had to be grown and transported to the
UK. Transatlantic transportation pollutes a lot. How
much carbon should be attributed to me, in this carbon
accounting?</p>

<p>People tend to attribute the carbon emitted during
transportation to me. But they also attribute it to the
farmer, the transport company and the British grocery
store. In other words, the same molecule of carbon was
added to the carbon books of four parties. That is bad
accounting.</p>

<p>The reality is simple. A molecule of carbon should be
added to the emitter’s book – and no one else’s. I didn’t
emit any carbon when buying the avocado – the transport company did.
If we see polluting as illicit or immoral,
then I did nothing wrong – the transport company is in
the wrong.</p>

<p>Each molecule of carbon emitted to the atmosphere has
an emitter. That person is responsible for this illicit act.
Third parties that might have facilitated this polluting
but haven’t themselves polluted are not acting unjustly.</p>
