                <p class="date">8 Mar 2023</p>

<p>There has been a growing trend over the last half-century or so
to defend animal rights. For some, human history has
moved towards the recognition of rights to a broader set
of people: slaves, women, and now, animals. Others even argue that,
just as we now view those who defended slavery two centuries ago
as morally wrong (despite their inability to see it at the time),
future generations may judge us similarly for permitting harm
to animals today.</p>

<p>This topic raises three key questions: Do any non-human beings
possess rights or individual moral relevance? If so, what
should those rights be? And which non-human beings count as
morally relevant? In what follows, I will focus solely on
the last question.</p>

<p>Advocates for the moral relevance of non-human beings tend
to focus almost exclusively on animals — more specifically,
on sentient animals.</p>

<p>But why should sentient animals have moral relevance simply
because they are sentient? Let’s return to a common argument:
that future generations will judge us as morally misguided
for failing to recognize animal rights, just as we now judge
past generations for defending slavery. This comparison is
often used to accuse our current thinking of speciesism.</p>

<p>However, this line of reasoning runs into a slippery slope.
If it's speciesist to exclude sentient animals, then why stop
there? Why exclude non-sentient animals? Or non-animal living
organisms like plants, fungi, and bacteria? Would that be a
form of “kingdom-ism”? And what about non-living entities —
viruses, or even inanimate objects like rocks, water, or chairs?</p>

<p>Returning to sentient animals: if sentience is what grants an
animal moral status, then it’s worth asking — does removing
that feature also remove its moral relevance? If a dog is born
with a rare condition that renders it non-sentient, does it
lose the moral status we afford its sentient peers? What if
a sentient dog is given a drug that removes its sentience
without causing any pain? And what if the same drug were
administered to a human being instead of a dog?</p>

<p>Beyond sentience, it seems that society often values traits
that are — arguably — morally irrelevant when assigning moral
status to animals. The most obvious example is cuteness. Cute
animals — dogs, cats, foxes, deer, and so on — are typically
given greater moral consideration than other sentient animals,
like rats. Even squirrels, which are rodents too, carry similar
diseases, and rummage through garbage just like rats, are
seen as more worthy of protection simply because they’re more
aesthetically appealing. If someone kills a rat on the street,
no one reacts — but if that person kills a beloved squirrel,
people are outraged.</p>

<p>Size seems to play a role as well. Generally, the larger the
animal, the more moral status we attribute to it, even beyond
considerations like endangered status. A deer tends to be seen
as more morally significant than a squirrel, and a shark more
than a zebrafish. “All animals are equal, but some are more
equal than others”, as Orwell said.</p>
